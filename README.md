# License Classifier

This is a fork of [github.com/google/licenseclassifier](github.com/google/licenseclassifier)

It has been updated to appropriately detect BUSL license texts that are actively in use.

Only the [v2](github.com/pulumi/licenseclassifier/tree/main/v2) version has been updated. v1 has been marked as deprecated.
